Travel Review Rating
This dataset was fairly small to do any heavy prediction work but I wanted to see if I could predict the rating of the comment  based on the review anyway! To start off I'll bring in the modules I want to use:
i)Sklearn 
ii)Pandas
iii)Numpy
iv)Matplotlib
v)Nltk

Taking a quick look at the data it became clear that were some basic issues that needed to fixed before starting. I noticed that some reviews had a '0' rating and some reviews had a rating above '5', I filtered these records out of the dataset to start and did a bit more cleaning here.
