All hotels included wonderful breakfasts and were very well located for getting around on our own after our planned tours,5

This week was absolutely awesome,5
I've lived in Melbourne for 6 months previously and not experienced half of what I did in just 8 days on this tour. If you want to get to know what it's like to live in this amazing city you have to do the tour. The help and advice you receive both during and after the tour is worth the price all by itself,4
"Such an amazing week to get you settled in the city and meet such great people. All the staff are amazing and so helpful with everything, particularly Claudia who was our guide for the week.",5
"She had great recommendations, knowledge of wildlife/history and helped create such a fun atmosphere the whole time",5
